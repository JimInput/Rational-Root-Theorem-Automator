## Using the Rational Root Theorem Automator
Usually the method to get the rational roots of a polynomial are tedious and annoying, so this program simplifies the process.

- First, decide on the degree of your polynomial.
- Next, input each of its coefficients and you are done!
- Please input as many invalid numbers as possible into the software, I want more practice with my try {} catch() {} statements.

A lovely new project (basically) finished, I don't see how much it can be enhanced.

Maybe I'll come back to this project a new man one day and have a realization that this code is crap.
